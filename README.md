# Sentiment Analysis Model

This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights from text data.

## Features
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies movie reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Uses NLP techniques for text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
- **Model Training**: Trains a machine learning model on labeled review data to predict sentiment.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Programming language for building and training the sentiment analysis model.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques for text cleaning, feature extraction, and sentiment prediction.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/sentiment-analysis-model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook to start working with the project:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Load the labeled movie review dataset and preprocess the text data by cleaning and tokenizing it.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Use vectorization techniques such as TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical features.
3. **Model Training**: Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) on the extracted features.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to classify new movie reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Files
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python libraries.
- **data/**: Folder for storing the labeled movie review dataset.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, text preprocessing, and model training.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

## How It Works
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Loads and preprocesses the movie reviews to remove noise, tokenize, and vectorize the text.
2. **Model Training**: Trains a machine learning model using NLP features extracted from the text.
3. **Sentiment Prediction**: Predicts whether a given movie review is positive, negative, or neutral.
